# Katalon Recorder Helper

Due to limitations in JavaScript and browsers' API, there are some actions that cannot be done by Katalon Recorder alone. In these cases, Katalon Recorder will send commands to a CLI tool named Katalon Recorder Helper to finish the actions.

Katalon Recorder Helper is an open source project. It is actually a very lightweight Java server that listens for commands from Katalon Recorder. It is built on top of the Spring Boot framework.

Please see the usage here https://docs.katalon.com/x/PQTR.
